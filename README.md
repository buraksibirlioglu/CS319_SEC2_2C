## Project Overview
In this project we will be developing a 2D game which will be built using Java. Named PANZER2017, the game is going to be based on the old  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opoib-Q_UGw">TANK 1990</a> arcade game. The main purpose of this game is to protect the castle from getting destroyed by the enemies. The user, may move his/her tank all around the map and can shoot missiles as well. The user gains points based on enemy tanks destroyed throughout the game. User also can upgrade his/her tank by collecting awards in a limited time interval.If the user manages to destroy all of the enemies,stage will be cleared.
